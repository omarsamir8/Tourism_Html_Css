          The Great Pyramid of Giza is a UNESCO-listed World Heritage site, the
          oldest and last remaining of the original Seven Wonders of the World.
          Additionally, this pyramid is the oldest and largest of all nine
          pyramids found at the Giza Necropolis, and is the final resting place
          of King Khufu. The Pyramid was completed in 2560 BC and took around 20
          years to build!The Great Pyramid was the tallest building in the world
          for 3,800 years! In fact, the first building to surpass its height was
          the Lincoln Cathedral in England, constructed in 1311. In comparison,
          the Pyramids of Khafre is 448 feet tall, which is about 100 feet
          taller than the Statue of Liberty. The third main pyramid, the Pyramid
          of Menkaure, is much shorter at 213 feet. This is about the same
          height as the famous sails on Australia’s Sydney Opera House.

          Originally, the temple complex sat on the banks of the River Nile. But
          over the years, the water began to rise and pose a threat to the
          ancient temple. The government decided to relocate the temple in 1964.
          Managed by UNESCO, experts cut the temples into several pieces to
          ensure nothing got damaged. They moved the temple 200 metres back from
          the river, away from the rising Lake Nasser waters. Even today, it’s
          considered one of the most challenging archaeological processes in
          history. It wasn’t cheap either. Countries around the globe raised
          around $42 million to safely move the temple. The temple is just as
          sturdy as it was 2,000 years ago. According to experts, if a 10-Rich
          earthquake hit the temple, it would survive.

          e Karnak Temple is located in the ancient city of Thebes (Luxor today)
          in Egypt. It was a place for the ancient Egyptians to worship their
          gods. Karnak is an Arabic word that means ''fortified village.'' To
          the ancient Egyptians, Karnak was a sacred place. The Temple of Karnak
          was believed to be the spot where creation began. They also believed
          it was a point of interaction between the god Amun-Ra and Egyptians.
          It is important to Egypt's cultural history because it was a place of
          worship and provides clues about the ancient Egyptian religion. There
          were no libraries in ancient Thebes, so history was recorded on the
          walls of Karnak. Pharaohs had successful events inscribed into the
          walls. For instance, there are inscriptions about territory gained
          under Amenhotep III. There are also religious inscriptions on the
          walls.

          Saqqara is a very important part of the Memphis necropolis, about 40
          km from Cairo. Saqqara probably took its name from the cemetery's
          "sugar" deity. Saqqara is truly an open museum, as Saqqara includes
          most of the monuments of ancient Egyptian history, as it contains the
          tombs of kings and senior officials of the first and second families
          (about 3040-2686 BC), and the Step Pyramid also included the oldest
          huge stone building in history for King Zesar (about 2686-2667). BC),
          and it contains pyramids of the most important kings in the Fifth
          Dynasty (about 2494-2345 BC) and the Sixth (around 2345-2181 BC),
          where the pyramid of King Wanis (around 2375-2345 BC) was the first to
          inscribe his burial chamber with texts The pyramids, which were
          intended to protect the king during his journey in the other world. In
          addition to the royal tombs of the Old Kingdom, Saqqara contained an
          enormous group of tombs of senior individuals

          The Jabal Al-Silsilah area in Aswan Governorate is one of the most
          important archaeological areas of the ancient Egyptians, given that it
          is the area of ​​quarries from which all the temples in the ancient
          and modern Pharaonic state were built, in addition to being also a
          workshop for building pharaonic chapels and obelisks and transporting
          them to their various locations.The archaeological area of ​​Gebel
          el-Silsilah is located approximately 20 kilometers north of the city
          of Kom Ombo in Aswan Governorate, and is divided into two parts,
          “Jabal el-Silsilah West” and “Jabal el-Silsilah East,” with the Nile
          River between them.The Jabal al-Silsilah area is characterized by
          being rich in sandstone, from which the Esna Reservoir on the Nile
          River was built in 1906, and it includes a group of quarries.

          uring periodic excavations in 2011 AD in a tomb of dogs in the Saqqara
          necropolis, an excavation team led by Salima Ikram and an
          international team of researchers led by Paul Nicholson of Cardiff
          University discovered nearly eight million animal mummies at a burial
          site next to the sacred Temple of Anubis. It is believed that these
          mummified animals, most of which are dogs, were meant to convey the
          prayers of their owners to their gods. In July 2018 AD, Ramadan Badri
          Hussein, head of the Egyptian-German team of researchers from the
          University of Tübingen, announced the discovery of an extremely rare
          gilded burial mask likely dating back to the Persian Sawi era in a
          partially damaged coffin. The last similar mask found was in 1939. The
          eyes of the mask are decorated with obsidian, calcite, and a black
          gemstone, possibly onyx.

          The time of excavation of this obelisk is not precisely known. It is
          believed that work on it began during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut
          for the purpose of having it “transported” and installed in the Karnak
          Temple in Luxor. The lower surface of the obelisk, 42 ​​meters long,
          is still connected to the ground rock from which it was cut. The
          obelisk appears to have some traces of attempts to save part of it,
          and these attempts may have been during the reign of Thutmose III.
          Visitors can visit and view the obelisk. It gives a picture of how the
          ancient Egyptians cut stones. The ancient quarries area of ​​Aswan
          extends for about 6 kilometers parallel to the Nile River. Pink
          granite from this region was an important stone in building the
          pyramids in ancient Egypt. From these quarries, stones were cut to
          make solid coffins, false doors, interior coverings for rooms, and
          temple columns.

          The Aswan High Dam or the High Dam is a water dam on the Nile River in
          southern Egypt, established during the reign of Gamal Abdel Nasser,
          and the Soviets contributed to its construction. The dam helped a lot
          in controlling the flow of water and mitigating the effects of the
          Nile flood. Used to generate electricity in Egypt. The length of the
          dam is 3,600 meters, the width of the base is 980 meters, the width of
          the summit is 40 meters, and the height is 111 meters. The volume of
          the dam body is 43 million cubic meters of cement, iron and other
          materials, and a water flow of up to 11,000 cubic meters of water per
          second can pass through the dam. Construction of the dam began in 1960
          and the total cost was estimated at one billion dollars, one-third of
          which was written off by the Soviet Union. 400 Soviet experts worked
          on the construction of the dam and completed its construction in 1968.
          The last 12 electric generators were installed in 1970 and the dam was
          officially opened in 1971.
