          different styles, reasonable prices and the staff can talk you through
          everything in English! Also packed my purchases very well so they did
          not get damaged in my suitcase travelling home. A real gem, will be
          back!Queríamos comprar un papiro autentico para casa. Encontramos esta
          tienda y fue todo perfecto. Tienen una colección muy amplia y buenos
          precios (sobre todo si se compara con los precios de la Casa del
          Papiro, que es donde te llevan en las visitas guiadas. Aquí cuestan
          menos de un tercio). Nos atendieron muy bien sin ningún tipo de
          agobio. Nosotros compramos una de la diosa Isis que llevábamos un par
          de días buscando
