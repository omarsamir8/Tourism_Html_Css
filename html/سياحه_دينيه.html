          Al-Azhar Mosque is one of the most important mosques in Egypt,
          especially since it has a huge status as a historical stronghold for
          spreading the teachings of the Islamic religion, in addition to its
          status as a famous archaeological mosque in Egypt and the Islamic
          world as well. As for the history of the construction of Al-Azhar
          Mosque, we find that it was built during the era of the Fatimid state
          in Egypt, which was conquered by Jawhar al-Siqilli in the year 969 AD.
          A number of changes took place in the mosque as a form of development

          the Alabaster or Alabaster Mosque due to the frequent use of this type
          of marble in cladding its walls. The successors of Muhammad Ali Pasha
          took care of the mosque, so they completed the construction and added
          some simple additions to it. They also made it a place for celebrating
          annual religious events, and they were, in order, Abbas Hilmi Pasha I,

          mosque built in the Islamic capital of Egypt after the Amr ibn Al-Aas
          Mosque, which was built in Fustat, and the Al-Askar Mosque, which was
          built in the city of Al-Askar, although the Amr ibn Al-Aas Mosque
          still exists. However, the Tulunid Mosque is considered the oldest
          existing mosque in Egypt to date because it has preserved its original
          state compared to the Amr Ibn Al-Aas Mosque, which underwent several
          repairs that changed its features.

          If the pyramids are the most awe-inspiring feature of ancient Egypt,
          then the Sultan Hassan Mosque is Egypt's Islamic school and the most
          famous monument in the Islamic world. The Sultan Hassan School or
          Mosque, this giant edifice, was founded by Sultan Hassan, son of the
          great Mamluk Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad bin Qalawun, in 1361 AD, and
          work on it continued for 4 years. Sultan Hassan died before the work
          on it was completed. Restorations were made to the mosque in 1915 AD

          Egypt has witnessed the growth of the Christian religion and therefore
          has some of the most important places representing the Christian
          religion, including the Monastery of St. Catherine and many Orthodox,
          Protestant, and Catholic monasteries and churches. St. Catherine's
          Monastery was built in 565 AD to accommodate monks who were settlers
          in the Sinai Peninsula. The monastery is located on Mount Catherine in
          Sinai. One of the things that generates more tourist and historical
          interest inside it is the presence of a library that includes the
          largest collection of books, about 3,500 books in different languages.

          and enjoy the Coptic murals after their renovation and spend an
          enjoyable time in worship. The only weak point of this monastery was
          its accessibility and lack of water and in fact this was the reason

          The Monastery of Saint Paul is one of the most important religious
          tourist places in Egypt, and its construction dates back to the fourth
          century AD. A visit is worthwhile because it gives you a glimpse into
          the still life, prayer and asceticism that flourished there in the
          eastern desert nearly 2,000 years ago. You can wander freely around
          the monastery, provided that you are accompanied by a guide with an
          English-speaking monk who will allow you to access many of the closed
          areas of the monastery.
